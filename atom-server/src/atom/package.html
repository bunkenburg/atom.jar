		This package implements Atom syndication and publishing.
		See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287 and http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023.
		
		<p>
		This package requires Java 5.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The classes in this package receive Atom http requests, 
		parse and interpret the GData URL parameters, delegate the
		calls to some LAOs, and transform the results into XML.
		The central class is AtomServlet, which you should inherit from.
		The most important classes are:
			<ul>
				<li>AtomServlet. Serves Atom requests.</li>
				<li>Feed. JavaBean for an Atom feed.</li>
				<li>Entry. JavaBean for an Atom entry.</li>
				<li>XSDServlet. Serves requests for XML schemas.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The package atom.gdata implements the GData query language.
		</p>

		<h2>Easy SAX style</h2>
		<p>
		An Atom feed is an XML document. The most straightforward implementation would be to get the offers,
		transform them into entries, and build up an object model of the Atom feed. Then, transform the object
		model of the Atom feed into an object model of an XML document, and finally, serialise that to the
		response output stream. This is the DOM style of XML processing. Its main advantage is that it is easy
		to program. However, it requires that all of the data is in memory at the same time, possibly in 
		multiple representations. We use a lot of memory.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		An alternative is to use the SAX style of XML processing. We gather the data bit by bit, and serialise
		it to the output stream as we gather it. The whole data set needn't be in memory at the same time.
		This advantage is relevant for feeds with very many entries. We propose an easy SAX style, where the client
		programmer needn't use the SAX library at all. They must make methods that gather the data in a different
		way. Instead of returning lists, the must return objects that can return more data on demand, in Java,
		iterators. The iterator's hasNext() method calls the next() method on the underlying result set. The
		iterator's next() method calls the getX(..) methods of the underlying result set and returns one freshly
		instantiated business object. The last call to hasNext(), the one that returns false, also closes the 
		underlying DB Connection. In the diagram, that is indicated by rs.close(); in fact it would be con.close().
		In the diagram, there is only iterator. In fact, there may be several iterators, one delegated to another
		and applying some transformation of the returned data.
		</p>

		<p>
		Finally, only within the serialising method of Feed, do we really use SAX. We first serialise the feed meta
		data, then the entries as they are produced from DB, and finally we close the &lt;feed> tag.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The technique requires anonymous inner classes and care with the closing of the connection. I propose
		closing he connection on the last hasNext that returns false, in finalize(), and also in remove(), 
		re-interpreting the methods remove() for when the client wants to signal that they are not going to
		iterator any more.
